# Pharmaceutical Products Inventory V1

This project is part of my **Web Penetration Testing Path**, where understanding the underlying technologies is crucial for mastering security concepts. Since **JavaScript** is an integral part of web security, this project focuses on learning and applying JavaScript fundamentals through practical implementation.

The goal of this project is to **practice and deepen my understanding of JavaScript** while building an inventory system for a pharmacy. The system allows users to add, delete, edit, and view orders using only frontend technologies: **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.

## Features

- **Inventory and Needs Display**: The page displays the pharmacy's inventory and the products needed for orders.
- **Add Products**: Users can add products either to the inventory or to the order.
- **Edit Products**: Users can modify any product in both the inventory and the orders list.
- **Delete Products**: Users can remove products from either the inventory or the orders list.
- **Place Orders**: Users can submit orders once they have added the desired products.
- **View Previous Orders**: Users can view a history of previous orders.
